MineOS is a series of tutorials and distributions designed to help Minecraft enthusiasts successfully host Minecraft on a Linux or BSD-based platform. It is currently distributed as an ISO (MineOS Turnkey) for fast deployment and lessening the Linux learning curve, but it can also be installed independently atop an existing BSD/Linux server.
